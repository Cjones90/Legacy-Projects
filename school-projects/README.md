In this repo you can view all my C++ school projects as I complete them through college. Each will have a .cpp source, a .exe to run in windows, and an executable to be run in the linux terminal. Maybe one day Ill start making executables for mac on my really old iBook, who knows. Each (might) contain a project specification as well, this is teacher specific so I don't know how long that will last.

Currently there are 5 projects (1 and 2 should be considered one) that I have worked on for class. The latest one (TopicF) is one completed the day of this commit so it has not been turned in and does not have documentation at this time.

They aren't large, super hard projects by any means but TopicF did actually a couple hours to work out some algorithmns.

Placing these on here is practice for git and for me and anyone else that wishes to view them to see the general progression of projects being made.

TopicF.exe is the only .exe that isn't mine, as I have not compiled it on Visual Studio yet (hate windows now). Other then that these are all mine from source (100 line programs impressive, I know).



To run the executable in linux:

You can run each individual program in linux if you do not wish to download the whole repo (it's not that large though). To do so follow these quick steps.

Note: If there are certain .txt files in the folder that you wish to run, unless you are familiar with svn checkout, you'll need to download the entire file. I might possibly separate the projects in the future when the projects get large enough.

1. Click on a folder you wish to view

2. Click on the Topic(x)Lin file.

3. Click "view raw", this will download the file.

4. Don't open the file from your browser download section, instead you will need to first:

	4.1 Open the folder the file downloaded in.

	4.2 Change the permissions on the file to allow (at least you) to execute the file

5. Then when you double click the file, run in terminal.

6. Profit

When I hop on Windows this weekend I'll list the steps to run the .exe as well.

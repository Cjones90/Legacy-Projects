(These two old templates haven't been updated in many months, although this repo might be used in the future)
These are two templates. site1 is the basic template to work/tweak off of.
site1proj is a spin off that does have a working login/logout that opens up the admin page for "input".

The "input" was an attempt to write to text files instead of databases for easy portability. This way as long as the user had the .txt file, it would write and retrieve from it. It doesn't work as intended and maybe revisted in the future.

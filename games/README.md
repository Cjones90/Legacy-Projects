Here are 3 games I've attempted at making. DragonSlayer is the only "functional" one. The other two are games I decided to mess around with to showcase some JS foo. With how they were going, I didn't feel adequetly equipped to tackle the problems that arose at the time. I've been focused more on getting more projects done then quality ones. This lead to many unfinished projects. Important thing is they are all learning experiences! 

Now I'm focused on making my main site www.techx.us as quality looking as a non-designer type can make a site.

Looking at it now, this is about the ONLY thing that I could really do to test out some JS foo. I look forward to working on these in the future now that I have them and all my other projects up online to showcase.

This folder with all the files for an older RueFilms site is probably 6 months+ old. I forgot how much time I put into it. It was a really fun and challenging project.

My goal was to create a CMS where my girlfriend could upload/delete photos, edit/delete posts, add/edit her portfolio, link her photos to her gallery, edit her about me section, all without me intervening. Needless to say she found it confusing (I cant blame her).

I learned a lot about PHP, MySQL, and AJAX with this project. It is undocumented (was still really new to programming) with loads of functions, POSTS, GETS, authentication, OOP PHP, and a whole mess of other stuff.

I need to grab the database file (thinking now, it should be to hard) in order for it to even function however, so its been left untouched. It is the initial template of the JointBalm mockup I have in my portfolio. This site should be hosted somewhere and Ill have to check out where.

Feel free to take whatever you like.

Id say overall in terms of complexity, this and JointBalm are 1st, an even older RueFilms is 2nd, DragonSlayer is 3rd, my HTML FAQ is 4th, and my main site Techx is 5th. I tried to simplify things as I went along in order to get as many things done. I'm sure I have some more things with horrid code and too much complexity.

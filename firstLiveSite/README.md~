This is the first website I made that was put up live on the internet. Only seems like yesterday. I had a lot of fun learning
about PHP and MySQL. I honestly forgot I did a lot more PHP/MySQL then JS back when I was starting.

I can read 90% of the code, however its undocumented and is an absolute mess. Code is flung in every which way with no
forethought of what was to come of it. It's really funny to be honest. It's late so this is a little short.
